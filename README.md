### Content

Everything content-related resides inside `content` folder.

Writ-CMS works in a simple way:

- Text files inside `content` become posts,
- Text files inside `content/pages` become subpages,
- A text file named `index` or `homepage` inside `content` becomes the homepage,
- Folders inside `content` become categories,
- In `content` or in a category, a folder containing a post.md becomes a foldered post.
- In `pages`, a folder containing a page.md becomes a foldered subpage.
- Posts inside categories become categorized posts.
- Any other files are registered as local assets to their closest parent entry (e.g. a post)

Sub-categories are currently not supported.

#### Text files

Text files can be written in HTML, markdown or plain text. You can use handlebars
expressions.

Accepted file extensions: `.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt`, `.html`, `.hbs`, `.handlebars`

Regardless of the format, text files may contain a front-matter section in the beginning
like this:
```
---
tags: web, hello world
---
Content comes here
```

### Theme

Everything theme-related resides inside `theme` folder.

#### Making quick changes

You can quickly make changes to the theme using `script.js`, `style.css` and `theme-settings.css`.

`scripts.js` and `style.css` recognize `theme/assets/custom` as the current directory.

Let's say you want to have a `colors.css` and import it into `style.css`:
- Put `colors.css` into `theme/assets/custom`
- Import it in `style.css` with: `@import url('./colors.css');`

#### Full editing

You can change how everything looks and behaves by making changes in `theme/templates` folder.

All templates are rendered using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com).

- `templates/base` handles the lower-level html organization
- `templates/components` and `templates/layouts` contain some reusable templates
- `templates/features` is automatically generated based on your settings, but your edits are preserved.
- `templates/pages` contains the templates for each page type.
- `templates/helpers.js` contains Handlebars helpers.

After making changes to the Handlebars helpers, you need to restart the watcher.
By default, all posts will have 'text' type.

##### Adding new post types

`templates/pages/post` has a few subfolders, corresponding to different post types.
By adding another, you simply introduce a new post type.

You can set a post's type by adding `type: nameOfTheType` in its front-matter.

### Configuration

Writ-CMS is configured in the `settings.json` and extended programmatically inside `_scripts`.

`_scripts` folder is used by npm scripts. Here `_scripts/writ.js` extends the
writ-cms by using a hook for customizing the content model.
