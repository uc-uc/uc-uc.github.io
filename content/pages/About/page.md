Hello, this is Uç! Uç!

Exploring themselves at the intersection of meditative improvisations and psychedelic oscillations,  
with their broad sound spectrum, can wink at any genre of jazz and world music. 

Having released their first album and live session video in 2019, Uç! Uç! followed up with the “Faerie Journey” album  
and the “Sadness of Illusion” single in November 2023.   

In August 2024, they released the album “Feeding the crows by hand”
