Early New Year Festival at Karga Kadıköy - December 28th  

We’re thrilled to invite you to our Early New Year Festival on December 28th at Karga Kadıköy! We’re a group of friends who’ve put together something really special, and we’d love for you to be a part of it.   

Uç Uç will kick things off with some amazing tunes.  

Upstairs is Boiling, and the energy is going to be.. hmm, expect the unexpected. 

Şu Güzel İnsanlar will bring some chill vibes with their soothing melodies.  

Erdem, Özün, and Ozan will close the night with an epic drum trio performance.  

And just when you think the night is winding down, we’ll keep the energy high with a DJ set that’ll keep you dancing until the very end!  

Downstairs, our friends will be showcasing and selling their handmade creations, so it’s a great chance to support local artists and find something unique.  

We’ve put our hearts into organizing this festival, and we’re making sure it’s going to be an amazing night full of great music, creativity, and positive vibes.   

So mark your calendars for December 28th, and come celebrate with us at Karga Kadıköy! We can’t wait to see you there!
