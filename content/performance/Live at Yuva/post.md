Everything you see and hear in this performance is created and performed 'right then and there.'  
It cannot be repeated and could not have been predicted beforehand.  
Music thrives when no one knows anything about it beforehand.

Exploring themselves at the intersection of  
meditative improvisations and psychedelic oscillations,  
Uç! Uç!,  
with their broad sound spectrum,  
can wink at any genre of jazz and world music. 

Having released their first album  
and live session video in 2019,  
Uç! Uç! followed up with the “Faery Journey” album  
and the “Sadness of Illusion” single in November 2023.   
In August 2024, they released the album   
“Feeding the crows by hand”
