O dear listener !

The album you're listening to is just a spiritual experiment that the musicians do on themselves.

The spirit of that music corresponds to the experiences of a fairy who suddenly wakes up in another universe and to the transformational magnificence of her inner world, that feast, that complexity, that tranquility and that emptiness.

Listen at your own risk.

We hope that these sounds, which musicians entered into the studio without any expectations, played for 4 hours and come out without any pre-talk and determination, will take you on this journey too.

In this process, where the musicians and the fairy are trying to find themselves, the aim is only to search for ourselves.

Everything was composed at that moment and recorded live.
