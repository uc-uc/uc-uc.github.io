      <p>Recorded in our studio in 2024, our first fully made in-house album is out! and we took no prisoners!</p>
<p>[TR]
Bu albümü stüdyomuzda 2024&#39;ün kış aylarında kaydettik.</p>
<p>Kendiliğinden oluşan, beklentisiz bir müzik ortaya çıktı.</p>
<p>Albümün adını No Prisoner’s koyduk.<br>“Gözünün yaşına bakmıyor” olarak çevrilebilecek bir tabir.<br>Kendi gözümüzün bile yaşına bakmadığımızdan olabilir.<br>Müzik ile ilgili bütün fikirlerin unutulduğu bir anda ne ortaya çıkabilir? Keşfin ardında bizim için o günlerde ne varsa, müzikte o ortaya çıktı.  </p>
<p>Albümün kapak fotoğrafı ODTÜ konserimizde bizi fotoğraflayan @datleus ‘a ait.</p>
<p>Sevgiler ve selamlar 🌳🌎 </p>
<p>Davullar: Mustafa Kemal Emirel @kemalemirel<br>Elektronikler, synthler: Tarık Akyol @tarikakyo<br>Piyano ve synthler: Onur Nevşehir @onurnevsehir<br>Teşekkürler: Volkan Berk, @ercanbektasulger  </p>

      <p>Our live performance album, recorded at Yuva, one of the most special venues in Kadıköy, at Karga, has been released.</p>
<p>You can listen to the album on all streaming platforms and Bandcamp.</p>
<p>As always, it&#39;s hard to define the genre of the album. It&#39;s the result of a mutual conversation and understanding. The music was composed and recorded on the spot as an improvisation. So, everything you see and hear in this performance is created and performed &#39;right then and there.&#39; It cannot be repeated and could not have been predicted beforehand. We think that music thrives when no one knows anything about it beforehand.</p>
<p>The album was mixed and mastered by Ercan Bektaş Ülger, and the cover design was done by Onur Nevşehir :)</p>
<p>There is also a video of our performance, recorded by the @idgk.tv team, which you can watch on YouTube.</p>
<p>So much love, Uç! Uç!</p>

      <p>O dear listener !</p>
<p>The album you&#39;re listening to is just a spiritual experiment that the musicians do on themselves.</p>
<p>The spirit of that music corresponds to the experiences of a fairy who suddenly wakes up in another universe and to the transformational magnificence of her inner world, that feast, that complexity, that tranquility and that emptiness.</p>
<p>Listen at your own risk.</p>
<p>We hope that these sounds, which musicians entered into the studio without any expectations, played for 4 hours and come out without any pre-talk and determination, will take you on this journey too.</p>
<p>In this process, where the musicians and the fairy are trying to find themselves, the aim is only to search for ourselves.</p>
<p>Everything was composed at that moment and recorded live.</p>

      <p>With their debut album “The Constant Fear of Being Judged (by you)” they bring forward the calm and rough, raw and refined sounds. Acoustically and polyrhymically played drums combined with texture based piano playing, an underground sound engineer with a guitar playing traditional and unconceptual melodies with a bass whose unstability sustain stability. A meditation like jazz music, which is almost in the realms of neo-classical music, meets sound design and experiments of emotions and sounds. It is like a calm carnaval where everybody gets a smile on their faces when everybody joins the spiritual wave that the band creates. Uç! Uç! makes an honest and conceptual minimal music which turns into something bigger with everystep into the music.</p>
